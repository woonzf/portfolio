# Portfolio

### [Live Demo](https://woonzf.github.io/portfolio/)

### About:

Hello, this is my first and current portfolio.

It was created as the final project: [Homepage](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-advanced-html-and-css-homepage) of The Odin Project's Advanced HTML and CSS Course.

I did not follow the template provided and try to make it more stylish. It is actually the second iteration as I am not satisfied with the [first one](https://github.com/woonzf/odin-homepage). In my opinion, the first one has better mobile view and this one has better desktop view.

Design inspired by [Wokine](https://www.awwwards.com/sites/wokine).
